# Blackhole - Products

Meteor package that adds products management functionality. 

## History

**Latest Version:** Work in progress on 0.0.1

## About

Purpose of this package is to add basic products managment functionality to your app. Once installed you will get:
 * Currencies management
 * Products and product types management
 * Pricing schemas management

This package does not provide any UI. But you can install one of our predifined UI packages if you want to or you can implement your own UI. Available UI packages:
 * Blackhole Admin Package - this provides UI for all Blackhole suite packages

I have tried to make this dead easy to start working with, but at the same time powerful. One of the goals was also to allow easily extend and customize it according to your needs. 

Products package is one piece from Blackhole suite. Blackhole is a project that aims to make it easy to build e-commerce apps with Meteor framework. Read more about it here.
